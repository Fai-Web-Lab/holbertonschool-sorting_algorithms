# Sorting Algorithms Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.  
It focuses on implementing and analyzing different sorting algorithms using the C programming language.

The main goals of this project are:
- Implement sorting algorithms from scratch
- Follow strict coding and style requirements
- Analyze time complexity using Big O notation
- Understand algorithm behavior in best, average, and worst cases
